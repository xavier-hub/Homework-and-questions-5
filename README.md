# Homework-and-questions-5
1. the ccs model box model is a box the wraps around the every html element. It consists of margins, boreders,padding and actual content. the margins clear a empty area outsider the borders and a border is actual border thst surrouds the padding and content. the padding area that goes around the content and the content is text and images that box.to find the css model box of my own website you need to use chrome developer tools elements tab and hover my body element to see my margins set at 8 border and padding 0 and the content is 869 x 1652.440.
2. to set the height and width of a element in css you just need set the hight and width of the conrent area
3. to properly set both the height and width you would take them and add their margins borders and padding number togather
4. for us we have to add the width + padding + border = actual width of an element and the same with height
5. the actual width is 592 
6. the actual height is 592 
7. It allows us to include padding and border in the element's total height and width and it defines the box-sizing: border-box
8. content-box: the default value the width and height properties include only the content border and padding are notincluded. intial: sets the box-sizing property to its default value. inherit: inherits the box-sizing property to its default value.
9. inherit would be the best to avoid reputting css
10. the default is to add the width and height with their border padding and margins and it all was appear at the full size and that because when the values are all added togather the make the area to fully fit the space.
11. if you set them the padding and border are included in the height and width
12. This css represents the area around the text and images in the content the padding is the area in the box an image or text go and the margins is the area between two box. and what padding does is make the area that goes around the content and margins clears a empty area outside the border and the universal selector in the rule set is box-sizing: border-box;.
13. The flow layout is the way that block and inline elements arae displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout
14. if element would be removed from normal flow it would be removed from the normal flow it would be remove from every box and that happens because once it remove for the parent box the children box remove it as well.
15. The propety position is used to over ride and remove elements from the normal flow and it speifiy the type of positoning method used for an element.
16. static,absolute,fixed,relative,sticky are the values. static elements render as they appear in the document flow and absolute is the element is positoned relative to its nearest poistioned ancestor element relative to the viewport. fixed is the element is positoned relative this means that its always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled and relative is the element is position relative to its normal position, so left 25px to the element's left position and lastly sticky is the element is positoned based on user's scroll position. ```position: static;``` ```position: absolute;``` ```position: fixed;``` ```posotion: relative;``` ```position: sticky;```.
17. 
18.  it is determined by which every index is higher is placed farther than others 
19.  if their two the last one put in will be on shown on top
20.  fluid design refers to a layout to page that adjust it components to the size of th view screen using percentage  width ```.wrapper { width: 50%; margins 50;}``` fixed design refers to a layout to a page that uses exact pixel width make all the components to stay the same resoultions ```wrapper {width: 500px;}```.
